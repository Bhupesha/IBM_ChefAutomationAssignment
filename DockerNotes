Volume is for mounting data between container and host
If I run docker container without any -v arguments will any volumes get created?

-v is not for creating the volume, just to mount the data from and to

-v [host_path]:[container_path],

here host_path, your server directory path where you want to mout the data to

container_path, container directory path mount date from

If I do specify a volume (which is not a mount to some location in host) does the volume become this container's writable layer?

When the path doesn't exist in the host. But you have mountaed it to container, there are two cases here.

CASE 1: If you want to mount some config files from your machine to container if the container expects that file while running then it throws error in the logs

CASE 2: If you want to mount the volume from container to host machine. When cotainer starts running it creates a folder in the host machine and writes the data to the host machine mounted directory.
